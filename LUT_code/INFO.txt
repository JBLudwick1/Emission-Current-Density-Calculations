Code to build lookup table.

Premade 4-Dimensional lookup table using the quantum mechanical wave impedance approach with the input parameters:
electric field magnitude [V/nm],
Temperature [K],
Radius of curvature [nm],
Work function [eV],
can be found in the COMSOL_Example folder labelled LUT_4D.mat.

To build a lookup table, open Main.m and appropriately set all the controls within this file.
